== Kernel ==

 * linux [amd64 i386 ia64 sparc]

== Desktop ==

A small first step to comprehensive certification. Unfortunately, lsb
includes lsb-desktop, which pulls in both gtk and qt, so we pick individual
modules instead.

 * lsb-core [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc]
 * lsb-cxx [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc]
 * lsb-graphics [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc]

For the xfce4 die-hard fans:

 * xfburn
 * xarchiver

== Server ==

 * ssh
 * lilo [amd64 i386]   # MattZimmerman wants this for server admins; needed for LVM installs
 * nfs-kernel-server   # need an NFS server
 * apache2-mpm-worker [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc]  # ThomMay; for simple file/web serving -> add zeroconf and we have swish mac os x style :-)
 * samba  [amd64 i386] # for Windows filesharing and integration
 * nis                 # allows Kickstart to configure NIS
 * ltsp-server-standalone [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc] # for LTSP-on-install
 * ltsp-client [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc]            # for LTSP-on-install
 * ldm [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc] # seeded because its not a hard dependency of ltsp-client anymore
