= Console-Based Tools =

These tools are very commonly used by people who drop into a console shell to do some work.

 * bc
 * dc
 * irssi
 * mkisofs
 * cdrecord
 * cdparanoia
 * dvd+rw-tools
 * screen
 * lftp
 * slocate              # tool to index user files
 * doc-debian           # move to Desktop since people doing a Base install probably won't need it
 * zip
 * unzip                # also used for .zip support in file-roller

= Network Services =

Basic network services and Windows integration.

 * smbclient           # to access files on other SAMBA and Windows servers
 * wvdial              # for automatic dialup configuration via g-s-t

These packages help with system integration

 * libsasl2-modules    # allows integration with MTA and login system

= Printing =

Printing and printer configuration is a real weak spot in Debian, and in Linux in general. We will need to stay at the front of the curve here.

 * cupsys                       # our preferred printer management infrastructure
 * cupsys-bsd                   # gives us lpc, lpq, lpr, lprm
 * cupsys-client                # gives us cancel, cupstestppd, lp, lpoptions, lppasswd, lpstat, cupsaddsmb, accept, lpadmin, lpinfo, lpmove
 * foomatic-db-engine           # integrate the foomatic printer driver engine
 * foomatic-db                  # the foomatic printer driver database
 * foomatic-filters             # converter from postscript to printer-specific formats
 * foomatic-db-gutenprint       # printer drivers from the gutenprint project
 * foomatic-db-hpijs            # printer drivers from the hp inkjet project
 * foomatic-filters-ppds        # a ton of ppds, large but gives us very comprehensive printer support
 * cupsys-driver-gutenprint     # a ton of cupsys ppds, for real comprehensive printer support
 * pnm2ppa                      # several ppds require this
 * gs-esp			# some ppds require this, in place of standard gs
 * hplip     			# support for HP all-in-one printers
 * hplip-ppds			# support for HP all-in-one printers
 * min12xxw			# support for KonicaMinolta PagePro 1200W, 1300W printers
 * foo2zjs			# Support for printing to ZjStream-based printers

= GUI infrastructure =

 * x-window-system-core
 * xterm
 * xserver-xorg-input-synaptics  # for enhanced touchpad features
