= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Architecture-independent ==

 * hotkey-setup
 * (hal-cups-utils) # fully automagic printer configuration

Power management:

 * acpi-support
 * (powernowd)
 * powermanagement-interface [i386 amd64 powerpc ia64]

== i386, i686, amd64 ==

 * acpi
 * acpid
 * apmd [i386]

== ppc32, ppc64 ==

 * pbbuttonsd [powerpc]

= Console-Based Tools =

These tools are very commonly used by people who drop into a console shell to do some work.

 * bc
 * dc
 * genisoimage
 * wodim
 * cdparanoia
 * dvd+rw-tools
 * screen
 * lftp
 * slocate              # tool to index user files
 * zip
 * unzip                # also used for .zip support in file-roller
 * vim-runtime

= Network Services =

Basic network services and Windows integration.

 * (libnss-mdns)       # IPv4 link-local DNS support
 * (avahi-autoipd)     # IPv4 link-local interface configuration support
 * smbclient           # to access files on other SAMBA and Windows servers
 * (wvdial)            # for automatic dialup configuration via g-s-t

These packages help with system integration

 * libsasl2-modules    # allows integration with MTA and login system
 * avahi-daemon

= Printing =

Printing and printer configuration is a real weak spot in Debian, and in Linux in general. We will need to stay at the front of the curve here.

 * cupsys                       # our preferred printer management infrastructure
 * cupsys-bsd                   # gives us lpc, lpq, lpr, lprm
 * cupsys-client                # gives us cancel, cupstestppd, lp, lpoptions, lppasswd, lpstat, cupsaddsmb, accept, lpadmin, lpinfo, lpmove
 * foomatic-db-engine           # integrate the foomatic printer driver engine
 * foomatic-db                  # the foomatic printer driver database
 * foomatic-filters             # converter from postscript to printer-specific formats
 * (foomatic-db-hpijs)          # printer drivers from the hp inkjet project
 * cupsys-driver-gutenprint     # a ton of cupsys ppds, for real comprehensive printer support
 * openprinting-ppds            # Most common drivers we want in desktop; less common are in o-p-extra
 * pnm2ppa                      # several ppds require this
 * ghostscript-x
 * (cups-pdf)			# PDF file writer virtual printer
 * (hplip)     			# support for HP all-in-one printers
 * (min12xxw)			# support for KonicaMinolta PagePro 1200W, 1300W printers
 * (foo2zjs)			# support for printing to ZjStream-based printers
 * (splix)			# support for Samsung lasers
 * (pxljr)			# support for HP Color lasers

= GUI infrastructure =

Packages used for X preconfiguration are just Recommends; removing them after initial installation should be relatively safe.

 * (xresprobe)
 * (laptop-detect)
 * (discover1)

 * xorg                          # this includes xserver-xorg->xserver-xorg-{input|video}-* (no need to add specific drivers manually)
 * xterm                         # Provide a backup terminal and complete X env.
 * xkb-data                      # XKB data now lives here

= Development =

Here we provide a minimal development environment sufficient to build kernel
drivers, so that this is possible on the live CD and in scenarios where
it is problematic to get these packages onto the installed system in order
to compile a driver. -mdz
