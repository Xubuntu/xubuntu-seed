We need a consistent policy for -doc. At the least, any -doc package produced by a source package that also generates a binary package in one of our seed lists should absolutely go into supported.

... and some miscellaneous exclusions for things we don't want to drag in
automatically (note that Extra-Exclude *only* prevents packages from being
included due to matching Extra-Include patterns, and has no other effect):
