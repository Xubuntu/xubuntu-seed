= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Generic ==

 * alsa-base # needed for proper hardware detection (hotplug/blacklist.d, modprobe.d)
 * alsa-utils           # basic audio support and mixer level handling
 * grepmap              # make hotplug faster
 * pcmciautils          # PCMCIA support for >= 2.6.13-rc1 kernels

== i386, i686 ==

 * libc6-i686 [i386]

== ppc32, ppc64 ==

 * mac-fdisk [powerpc]
 * pmac-fdisk [powerpc]
 * powerpc-utils [powerpc] # ColinWatson

= UNIX =

== Essential ==

These are packages which, in Debian, have "Essential: yes" in their control file.

 * base-files
 * base-passwd    # ColinWatson
 * bash
 * bsdutils       # LaMontJones
 * coreutils
 * debianutils
 * diff
 * dpkg
 * e2fsprogs
 * findutils
 * grep
 * gzip
 * hostname
 * initscripts
 * login
 * mount          # LaMontJones
 * ncurses-base
 * ncurses-bin
 * perl-base
 * sed
 * sysvinit
 * tar            # LaMontJones
 * util-linux     # LaMontJones

== Filesystem Support ==

These are commonly used filesystem support packages, here because someone setting up a server would begin with Base, configure filesystems and network and then add other services. NFS is explicitly not here, because it brings in nasties like portmap, and because the network will need to be running before it can be used, so we may as well put that in Supported.

 * reiserfsprogs
 * reiser4progs
 * libreiserfs0.3-0 # gives parted the ability to work with reiserfs
 * xfsprogs         # ThomMay
 * jfsutils
 * hfsutils [powerpc] # ColinWatson; support for apple filesystems
 * hfsplus [powerpc]  # ColinWatson
 * dosfstools

== Comfortable Unix System ==

Programs and packages necessary for both the proper functionality of the system and that any user would expect to find on a modern Unix-like system.

 * adduser
 * apt
 * aptitude          # our default package selection for warty base
 * apt-utils         # apt-extracttemplates is required for debconf preconfiguration
 * bzip2
 * console-tools
 * debconf
 * eject             # very popular, useful, small
 * gettext-base
 * gnupg             # introduce security from the very base
 * initramfs-tools   # needed for the Ubuntu kernel
 * less
 * libfribidi0       # right-to-left text support in newt
 * locales
 * lsb-release
 * makedev
 * mawk
 * module-init-tools # required for kernel 2.6
 * netbase
 * passwd
 * pciutils
 * procps
 * sudo              # LaMontJones
 * sysklogd
 * udev
 * usbutils
 * vim

== Networking ==

These provide various networking services, all should be configured in a client-only state with the server de-activated unless the user requires it.

 * dhcp3-client   # LaMontJones
 * iproute
 * ifupdown
 * net-tools
 * ntpdate        # FabioMassimoDiNitto
 * wireless-tools

= Debugging and Diagnostics =

A base system should be a good platform for diagnostics about the hardware and network. In other words, after installing just the Base system one should have everything one might need to get the rest of the system up and running the way you want it.

These are used for debugging problems or examining the system.

 * memtest86+
 * strace

== Network ==

 * ethtool
 * iputils-ping       # 
 * mii-diag
 * netcat             # FabioMassimoDiNitto

= Feature Goals =

These are warty key packages.

 * python             # a core feature goal for Warty

= Ubuntu =

 * ubuntu-minimal     # Ubuntu-specific bits we want on every Ubuntu system
 * ubuntu-keyring     # for authenticated package downloads
