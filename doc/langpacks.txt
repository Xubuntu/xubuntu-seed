Language pack sizes
===================

langpack-o-matic has a script 'langpacksize' that helps to determine
which packages fit on the CDs. You can download the latest version from 

  http://codebrowse.launchpad.net/~pitti/langpack-o-matic/main/files

This script prints a table of languages vs. categories and their
single and cumulative sizes; by default, the numbers are bytes, but
when being invoked with 'MB' as first argument, the numbers will be
MB.

E. g.:

en     G:     5.30  K:     5.55  G+K:     7.93  GSum:     5.30  KSum:     5.55 G+KSum:     7.93
es     G:     3.57  K:     4.76  G+K:     6.16  GSum:     8.87  KSum:    10.32 G+KSum:    14.09

'G' is the size of base+gnome (as needed for Ubuntu CDs), 'K' is the
size of base+kde (Kubuntu), 'G+K' is the size of base+gnome+kde
(Edubuntu). In this context, 'base' means packages which are UI
independent, such as coreutils, gcc, or hwdb-client.

The 'Sum' field show the cumulative size of the packages for that
language and all languages above it.

The list is vertically ordered by the priority, i. e. they should be
added from top to down.

Please note that these sizes do not only include language-pack-*, but
also the size of packages that provide input support for a particular
language.


Input support packages
======================

When shipping a language on a CD, the required input support packages
must be shipped as well:

zh: scim-chewing scim-pinyin scim-tables-zh
ja: scim-anthy
ko: scim-hangul
